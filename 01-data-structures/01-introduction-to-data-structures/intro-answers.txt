Line: 

Used the initialize method, an array, and linear ordered argument.

1. Appending a new member to the array. Each element is      iterated through to find a match for a particular        member. Removing a member and setting it to empty        or nil causes the line to be shorter. 

2. Like before to search for an certain member you have      to iterate over each element there is a match. 

3. A group of letters, or undo or redo words when typing    a paper


Pixel: 

Used an array within an array to make it 2D. (matrix)

1. Using x and y adding and removing a pixel refers to      the position directly with in the array. Removing a      pixel is more oa a reset of the position with nil.

2. Searching for a pixel using the x and y by accessing      the element indices within the 2D array. 

3. moves in a chess game or a social network feed where      things are added/removed randomly and specifically        searched.
